//Disabling SSR is usefull to solve hydration issues (when there was a difference between the React tree that was pre-rendered from the server and the React tree that was rendered during the first render in the browser). Create a const and add "NoSSR" at the end of the component name and import the component using the import() methode and setting SSR to "false". Then, return the component with "NoSSR".

    <div>

//Sometimes content will inevitably differ between the server and client, such as a timestamp. You can silence the hydration mismatch warning by adding suppressHydrationWarning={true} to the element. For example:

<time datetime="2016-10-25" suppressHydrationWarning />
